MOST Model Stats
================

Models evolve over time, and sometimes even marginal changes in the model description can have an impact.
Particularly when planning to reuse a model, it is necessary – and at the least interesting – to be informed about the changes in a model. The following questions can be addressed:

  * How often do models change?
  * What types of changes are frequently applied?
  * What are the reasons for these changes?
